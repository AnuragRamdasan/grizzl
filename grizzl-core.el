;; Grizzl provides a fuzzy completion framework for general purpose
;; use in Emacs Lisp projects.
;;
;; grizzl-core.el provides the underlying data structures and sesrch
;; algorithm without any UI attachment.  At the core, a fuzzy search
;; index is created from a list of strings, using `grizzl-make-index'.
;; A fuzzy search term is then used to get a result from this index
;; with `grizzl-search'.  Because grizzl considers the usage of a
;; fuzzy search index to operate in real-time as a user enters a
;; search term in the minibuffer, the framework optimizes for this use
;; case.  Any result can be passed back into `grizzl-search' as a hint
;; to continue searching.  The search algorithm is able to understand
;; insertions and deletions and therefore minimizes the work it needs
;; to do in this case.  The intended use here is to collect a result
;; on each key press and feed that result into the search for the next
;; key press. Once a search is complete, the matched strings are then
;; read, using `grizzl-result-strings'. The results are ordered on the
;; Levenshtein distance between them and the search term.
;;
;; It is assumed that the index will be re-used across multiple
;; searches on larger sets of data.
;;
;; A discussion of the algorithm can be found in the docs/ directory.
