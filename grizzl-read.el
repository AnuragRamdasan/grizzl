;;; --- Commentary

;; grizzl-read.el provides an implementation of the built-in Emacs
;; completing-read function, except it is backed by the grizzl fuzzy
;; search index. The goals are similar to ido-mode and helm, but grizzl
;; is heavily optimized for large data-sets, and as-such uses a
;; persistent fuzzy search index in its algorithm.
;;
;; The indexing and searching algorithm itself is defined in grizzl-core.el
;; with grizzl-read.el simply wrapping the search in a minibuffer with a
;; minor-mode defined.
;;
;; ---- Usage
;;
;; Call `grizzl-completing-read' with an index returned by
;; `grizzl-make-index':
;;
;;    (defvar *index* (grizzl-make-index '("one" "two" "three")))
;;    (grizzl-completing-read "Number: " index)
;;
;; When the user hits ENTER, either one of the strings is returned on
;; success, or nil of nothing matched.
;;
;; The arrow keys can be used to navigate within the results.
